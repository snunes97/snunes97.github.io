        Voxel Snake is the first game I created and published.
      </p>
      <p>
        After putting together a simple infinite-runner game with the help of a Youtube tutorial, I decided to try to make something on my own.
        As much as I wanted to go straight to making something awesome and original, recreating a simple game that already exists was a much better
        exercise for a beginner.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I took the basic knowledge I got from some tutorials and spent 3-4 weeks making Voxel Snake.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned a lot in the process, and since then, I’ve learned even more. Looking back, the system that moves the snake and its
        segments is very unoptimized and unreliable. That’s where most of the bugs in the game come from. The settings menu also ended up very weird and bare-bones,
        and the graphics could have been more refined.

        I made the 3D models with a free voxel modeling tool, and just dropped them in the game. I didn’t make any custom UI assets nor added any post-processing effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as the game seemed ready, I didn’t worry much about those last minute details and extras. I just wanted to finally publish a game.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, Voxel Snake is a very unstable and unrefined game, but it was a great exercise in learning Unity, and discovering the general process of making a game.
