        After I published my first game (Voxel Snake) on Game Jolt, I was contacted by a group of aspiring game developers who were looking for a programmer.
        They were trying to develop and release their first game, but were having trouble coming up with a project that wasn’t too big for the team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I accepted to be part of the team, and proceeded to go through their list of ideas for the project. One of those ideas was a simple remake of the
        dinossaur infinite-runner game by Google. It was obvious that the guys wanted to make something big and original, but for beginners, a smaller game
        would be more feasible. So we went with the dinossaur game!
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d already gone through a Unity tutorial about infinite-runners in the past, so I had a decent idea of how to put the game together.
        Still, there were some challenges.

        I had to do some research about how colliders/hitboxes and collisions work, because collisions between the dino and the obstacles were
        often ignored or miscalculated. In the end, it all seemed to work out fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest challenge though, was finishing the game before the end of the summer break. I was going off to university, so my free time
        was going to disappear. As a result, the game was a bit rushed. The game could have been more polished in general. I would’ve liked to
        spend more time reviewing the code and testing everything out, but in the end, the deadline had been reached, and the final product was exactly
        what we wanted it to be.
