      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
        My name is Simão Nunes. I’m a computer science student and I’ve been studying software and web development since 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've focused mostly on <b>web development</b>, working with both <b>front-end</b> and <b>back-end</b>. I also have a special interest in <b>video game
        development</b> and have been learning how to make games using the <b>Unity engine</b> since 2018. As a result of learnig how to make games, I've also learned some basics of <b>3D modeling</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time in university, I've been an active member of the IT students' club <b>(NESTI - Núcleo de Estudantes de Informática)</b>. As a regular associate,
        and later a member of the administration, I helped organize multiple events like the annual technology festival <b>Playnesti</b>, the educational event <b>CodeWeek</b> and multiple competitive gaming tournaments.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, I want to keep developing my skills and learn more and better ways to create websites and applications.
      </p>
